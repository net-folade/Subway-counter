# Subway Counter

This is a simple web app I built to practice JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It works like a people counter â€” you click a button every time someone enters, and it increases the count. There's also a save button to keep track of previous counts, and a restart button that resets everything.

## Features

- Increment button to add to the count
- Save button to record current count and reset it to zero
- Restart button to clear the saved entries and reset everything
- Custom font and basic styling with CSS
